# COVID19 Genomics 

Data for publications related genomic epidemiology 
for the Victorian SARS-CoV-2 response from
The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity
and the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services
in Australia.

### Reads

Raw genome sequence reads have been deposited at NCBI SRA within 
[PRJNA613958](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA613958).
Every isolate was sequenced with Illumina paired-end 150bp reads.
Some isolates have additional Nanopore data.

### Consensus genomes

Early versions of consensus genomes were deposited in 
[GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/),
but some were rejected due to "frame shifts". FASTA files
for _all_ genomes are available in this Github repository.

### Alignments

Coming soon.
